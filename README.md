A Java libary of robustness design patterns

=About JRugged=
The JRugged library implements some common patterns needed for building robust, production-ready server code in Java. It provides straightforward add-ons to existing code to make it more tolerant of failures and easier to manage. In other words, it makes your Java code more _rugged_!

Getting started is easy, just check out our [Examples] page.  If you would just like to browse the wiki you can start on our [MainPage Wiki Main Page]

=News=
*14 March 2012*: Version 3.0.3 of the JRugged Library released!
  * Fixed issue #55: Use {{{InitalizingBean}}} extension rather than @Autowired
  * Fixed issue #54: Non-threadsafe usage of {{{LatencyTracker}}} in {{{PerformanceMonitor}}}
  * Fixed issue #53: Copyright year update
  * Fixed issue #50: Tread Safety in {{{SampledQuantile}}}
  * Issue #49: Updated Java doc information to clarify usage of {{{Initializer}}}
  * Issue #48: Autodiscover @{{{CircuitBreaker}}} Annotations

*19 September 2011*: Version 3.0.0 of the JRugged Library released!
  * Fixed issue #35: Cleaned up and added Java Doc where it was missing
  * Fixed issue #37: Fixed an NPE in {{{PerformanceMonitor}}}
  * Fixed issue #38: NPE from {{{DefaultFailureInterpreter}}} (synchronization issue)
  * Enhancement issue #40: Allows a {{{CircuitBreaker}}} to start/initialize in a hard trip state.
  * Enhancement issue #41: Provide an exception mapper patter for the {{{ConstantFlowRegulator}}}
  * Fixed issue #42: Compilation error due to log4j dependency
  * Enhancement issue #43: The annotations available in the aspects package can now make use of the beans for {{{PerformanceMonitor}}}s and {{{CircuitBreaker}}}s allowing for a much cleaner implementation.  The annotations are now much more useful and robust.
  * Enhancement issue #44: {{{RolledUpStatus}}} was improved to allow a more concise status reporting.  The naming of the classes associated with the status have changed as well - to improve the readability and understandability of the code base.
  * Enhancement issue #45: Changed the pom's to include a more recent version of Spring (3.0.5)
  * Enhancement issue #46: Added a way in the spring integration to automatically 'discover' those classes with the annotations included in the aspects package to auto-publish their JMX information if there is a JMX server already registered in the spring config.
