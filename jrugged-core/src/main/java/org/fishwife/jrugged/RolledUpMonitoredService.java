/**
 * A {@link RolledUpMonitoredService} provides for grouping
 *  {@link MonitoredService} instances together into a single system for status
 *  reporting purposes. Subsystems are divided into <em>critical</em> and
 *  <em>noncritical</em> groups. The system as a whole will only report UP
 *  status (GREEN) if all subsystems, critical and noncritical alike, are
 *  likewise UP. Critical systems are necessary for providing functionality
 *  within the system, so the system as a whole reports the lowest
 *  (least functional) status of any critical systems which are not UP. If all
 *  critical systems are UP, but one or more noncritical systems are not UP,
 *  then the system as a whole will be in the DEGRADED (YELLOW) state.
