/** Clients who use the {@link Initializer} should implement this interface.
 *  This lets them do, for example:
 *  <pre>
 *    new Initializer(this).initialize();
 *  </pre>
 *  and the Initializer will take care of retrying an initialization.
 *
 *  This pattern is good for subsystems that need to talk to something
 *  that is currently down at startup time. For example, if your database
 *  is down when your app server starts up, this can let your app server
 *  keep trying to connect without getting wedged or needing to restart.
