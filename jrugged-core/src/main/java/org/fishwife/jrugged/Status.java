/** Various components in the system need to report their status. This
 *  <code>enum</code> standardizes on a set of conventions for reporting
 *  this. Each {@link Status} has an integer <code>value</code> which can
 *  be compared; higher values represent higher levels of functionality.
 *  In addition, each {@link Status} has a {@link String} <code>signal</code>
 *  which is either GREEN, YELLOW, or RED.
 *  <p>
 *  The general notion is that the whole system (or a subsystem) should
 *  only report GREEN status (UP) if everything is working as designed.
 *  When subsystems start to go down, or the current system stops working,
 *  status should drop to either YELLOW (DEGRADED) or RED (DOWN), depending
 *  on whether service was still available in some form. For example, if
 *  a cache subsystem goes down, we might report a YELLOW status because
 *  we can attempt to serve without a cache. However, if a required database
 *  goes down, we probably need to report a RED status, unable to serve
 *  requests.
 *  <p>
 *  A "rugged" system should be able to accurately (and responsively)
 *  report on its status even if it is unable to perform its main functions.
 *  This will assist operators in diagnosing the problem; a hung process
 *  tells no tales.
